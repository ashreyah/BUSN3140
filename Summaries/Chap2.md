---

## Objective 2-2: PESTLE — The Political Environment

* Consumers **vote with their wallets**, choosing products aligned with their beliefs.
* Ethical sourcing and fair treatment affect consumer preferences.
* Studies show many consumers **willing to pay more** for ethically sourced products.
* Younger consumers are especially vocal about expecting companies to **publicly declare social responsibility**.

---

## Consumer Activism

* Consumers actively **oppose unsafe or harmful practices**.
* Historical examples: Rachel Carson’s *Silent Spring* (1962), Ralph Nader’s *Unsafe at Any Speed* (1965).
* Current activism covers:

  * Environmental concerns (climate change, toxic waste)
  * Social issues (Black Lives Matter, income inequality)
  * Media content (violence, sex in music/TV)

---

Here’s a clear and organized summary of the **Corporate Activism**, **Slacktivism**, and **Economic Environment** sections from Chapter 2, focusing on key points and concepts for your study:

---

# Chapter 2 (continued): Consumer Ethics, the Marketplace, and the Planet

---

## Corporate Activism

* **Corporate Sociopolitical Activism (CSA)**: Companies taking a **public stand on social or political issues** (e.g., LGBTQIA2S+ rights, voting rights, racial justice).
* Examples:

  * **Nike supporting Colin Kaepernick** and Black Lives Matter.
  * **Delta Airlines cutting ties with the NRA** after a school shooting.
* Business benefits:

  * Despite fears, CSA can **boost sales and brand loyalty**.
  * Nike’s revenues increased 10% after taking a stand.
* Risks:

  * CSA can **polarize consumers**; investors react positively if aligned with stakeholders, negatively if not.
* Corporations are now **among the most trusted institutions** in America for social issues.

---

## Slacktivism

* Refers to **minimal or symbolic online activism** (e.g., liking a post, signing a petition) that may **reduce actual involvement or donations**.
* Sometimes a public display of support satisfies the person’s need to be seen as supportive, so they **do not take further action**.
* Critics warn slacktivism may **limit real social impact**.

---

## Objective 2-3: PESTLE — The Economic Environment

### Market Access and Economic Barriers

* Many consumers **lack equal access to markets** due to:

  * Physical barriers (disabilities, mobility issues)
  * Economic barriers (poverty, credit access)
  * Social or mental barriers (stigmatization, anxiety)
* Lack of access causes psychological harm and can create **vicious cycles of market disengagement**.
* People repeatedly denied market access often choose **harmful options** (e.g., high-interest loans).

---

### Disabled Consumers

* Over **1 billion people globally live with disabilities**; in the U.S., over 10 million adults.
* Many rely on **online and catalog shopping** due to mobility challenges.
* Disability also affects access to entertainment, education, and social participation.
* Despite a large disposable income (\$645 billion in the U.S.), disabled consumers are **often ignored by marketers**.
* Physical barriers: narrow aisles, inaccessible dressing rooms.
* Mental health issues such as PTSD also impact market engagement.

---

Here’s a clear, organized summary of the **Consumed Consumers**, **Food Deserts**, **Literacy**, and **Participatory Action Research** sections from Chapter 2:

---

# Chapter 2 (continued): Consumer Ethics, the Marketplace, and the Planet

---

## Consumed Consumers

* People **exploited for commercial gain**, often unwillingly.
* Examples:

  * **Human trafficking & forced labor** — estimated 25 million people worldwide.
  * **Organ, blood, and hair donors** — lucrative black markets exist (organ trafficking valued up to \$1.7 billion/year).
  * **Babies for sale & surrogacy** — some surrogate mothers paid thousands; illegal sales attempts reported.

---

## Food Deserts

* Areas where **large portions of the population lack access to grocery stores** (urban: >1 mile, rural: >10 miles).
* Limited healthy food leads to poor diets, obesity, and disease.
* Approx. **23.5 million Americans live in food deserts**.
* Pandemic worsened financial insecurity; now **63% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck**.
* Many face difficult choices between paying for food or education.
* **38% of U.S. college students** experience food insecurity; minority students disproportionately affected.

---

## Literacy Challenges

* **Media literacy**: Ability to critically evaluate marketing and media messages.
* Many consumers assume online info (Google, Wikipedia) is accurate, which is often false.
* **Financial literacy**: Understanding money management, budgeting, and long-term planning is difficult for many.
* **Functional illiteracy**: About 1 in 7 U.S. adults can’t perform everyday reading tasks.

  * Low literacy leads to difficulties in understanding product info and market options.
  * Emotional burdens like shame and anxiety arise during shopping.
  * Consumers rely heavily on visual cues but often make costly mistakes.

---

## Participatory Action Research (PAR) / Transformative Consumer Research (TCR)

* Researchers collaborate with consumers (especially at-risk groups) to **not just study but improve social problems**.
* Topics include materialism, dangerous product consumption, compulsive buying.
* **Social marketing** uses marketing techniques to promote positive behaviors (e.g., literacy) and reduce harmful ones (e.g., drunk driving).
* Research helps improve policies on accurate labeling and protects vulnerable consumers (e.g., children from deceptive ads).

---

Here’s a focused summary of **Objective 2-4: How Marketers Respond to Social Issues to Shape Consumer Behavior**, based on the PESTLE framework’s Social Environment section:

---

# Objective 2-4: Marketers Responding to Social Issues (PESTLE: Social Environment)

---

## Key Social Trends Impacting Marketing

* Social justice movements like **Black Lives Matter** have pushed companies to rethink brand images and messaging.
* Examples:

  * **Uncle Ben’s** and **Aunt Jemima** retired mascots rooted in racial stereotypes, renaming themselves.
* **Cancel culture**: Public calls to boycott brands that make social missteps.

---

## Consumers Want Brands to Support Causes

* Consumers increasingly choose brands that align with **social causes** important to them:

  * Medical research, disease prevention
  * Social change and equity
  * Animal and child welfare
* **Cause marketing** aligns a brand with a cause to generate business and social benefits.

  * Example: 3 out of 5 consumers bought a product in the past year because it supported a cause.
* **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**: Businesses actively working to positively impact communities, employees, consumers, and the environment.

---

## The Benevolent Halo Effect

* When companies do good (even outside their core business), they improve reputation and customer goodwill.
* This can positively influence consumer perception of their products.
* However, this **halo effect disappears if consumers feel the company’s efforts are insincere or self-serving**.

---

## What Works Best

* Consumers appreciate CSR efforts especially in response to **natural disasters**.
* **In-kind donations** (e.g., food, clothing) are valued more than just monetary donations because they show genuine care.

---

## Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI)

* Consumers and markets hold companies accountable for irresponsible actions.
* Negative publicity from CSI can lead to **significant stock market losses**, especially if widely covered by media.
* CSI caused by foreign brands affecting domestic markets causes heightened damage.

---

## Examples of Cause Marketing

* **TOMS Shoes**: Famous for donating a pair of shoes for every pair sold.

---

Here’s a clear, structured summary of **Objective 2-5: Technological Changes Creating New Challenges for Consumer Protection**, based on the PESTLE framework’s Technological Environment section:

---

# Objective 2-5: Technological Changes & Consumer Protection Challenges

---

## Technology’s Dual Role

* New tech disrupts lives **for better and worse**:

  * Virtual reality and the **Metaverse** transform reality perceptions.
  * Automation and AI coexist with humans (e.g., Saudi Arabia granted citizenship to a robot).
* Privacy concerns grow as technology tracks consumers more deeply.

---

## Data Privacy

* Consumers enjoy convenience but worry about **how much personal data is collected**.
* Online activity (shopping, GPS location, Zoom meetings) generates extensive data.
* **Personalized ads** can feel **“creepy”** to many consumers.
* Laws like the EU’s **GDPR** try to protect privacy, requiring websites to notify users about data collection.
* However, many websites:

  * Don’t provide clear cookie notices.
  * Bury privacy policies in fine print few read.
* Consumers often feel **powerless over their data**.

---

## Data Accuracy & Fake News

* The rise of **“fake news”** and misinformation complicates trust in online content.
* Examples include baseless conspiracy theories (e.g., Bill Gates implanting microchips).
* Misinformation creates an **“infodemic”**, confusing people on important topics like health.
* Consumers must rely on multiple sources and fact-checking websites (e.g., FactCheck.org, Snopes.com).
* Marketers struggle with a **trust crisis**: only 3–4% of consumers trust salespeople or ads.

---

## Facial Recognition & Privacy Risks

* Tools like Facebook’s **Tag Suggestions** and Picasa’s facial recognition improve convenience.
* But facial recognition stores unique facial data, raising **serious privacy concerns**.
* Future risks include:

  * Marketers identifying people in public spaces.
  * Linking faces to credit, medical info, or emotions.
  * Smart billboards tailoring ads based on detected demographics or moods.
* This raises ethical questions about **tradeoffs between personalized service and privacy invasion**.

---

## Consumer Perceptions of Technology

* Consumers see tech as **both empowering and vulnerable**.
* Tech improves convenience (e.g., geo-location offers, instant deals).
* But invasive data practices create **material and psychological dependence**, sparking discomfort and distrust.
* Consumers actively try to **protect their privacy** by hiding digital footprints or restricting social media access.
* Despite personal efforts, **coordinated policies** are needed to safeguard privacy at scale.

* **Consumer addiction** is a psychological/physiological dependency.
* Online gambling is highly addictive, with fast-paced betting options.
* Example: A man hired gamers to kill his son’s characters due to his addiction.
* **Social media addiction** can induce withdrawal symptoms similar to drug dependency.
* The WHO classified “gaming disorder” as an official disease in 2018.
* Solutions like “substitute phones” mimic smartphone use to help users detox.
* Surveys reveal:

  * 41% of Americans check phones every few minutes.
  * 71% sleep with their phones.
  * Some prefer giving up sex over phones.

### The SHIFT Framework: Driving Prosocial Consumer Behavior

Marketers can promote positive consumer behavior using five key drivers known as the SHIFT framework:

1. **Social Influence**: Use social pressure and norms to encourage desirable behavior.
2. **Habits**: Encourage the formation of sustainable habits.
3. **Individual Self**: Appeal to personal identity, self-interest, and personality traits.
4. **Feelings and Cognition**: Use emotional appeals and appropriate framing in context.
5. **Tangibility**: Clearly show the impact of prosocial behavior (who benefits, self-efficacy).

**Example**: A hotel study showed that when guests committed to reusing towels and received a symbolic lapel pin, towel reuse increased by over 40%, saving the hotel substantial water and money.

### The “Tree-Huggers”: LOHAS Segment

* **LOHAS (Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability)** consumers are highly likely to purchase sustainable products and services.
* Also known as “Lohasians” or cultural creatives.
* Includes buyers of organic foods, energy-efficient appliances, hybrid cars, alternative medicine, yoga, and ecotourism.
* They represent about 25% of adult Americans, spending around \$290 billion annually on sustainable products.

### Greenwashing and Wokewashing: Skepticism Among Consumers

* **Greenwashing**: When companies exaggerate or falsely claim environmental friendliness.
* **Wokewashing**: When companies make false claims about being socially “woke” or progressive.
* Consumers are highly skeptical; 25% say they can’t verify if a product is genuinely green.
* Reports indicate over 95% of companies marketing as “green” make misleading claims.
* Since 2009, green-labeled products have increased 73%, but a large portion uses fake labels or lacks proof.
* 71% of consumers say they’d stop buying a product if misled about its environmental impact; 37% consider boycotting the entire company.
* Example: Walmart paid \$1 million to settle claims over misleading biodegradable plastic products.
