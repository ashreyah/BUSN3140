### **Core Concept: What is Consumer Behavior?**

Consumer behavior is the **study of how people select, buy, use, and dispose of goods, services, ideas, and experiences** to meet their needs and express their identities.

---

### **Objective 1-1: Why Consumption Is Central to Our Lives**

* We don‚Äôt just buy products‚Äîwe buy **experiences and meanings**.
* What we consume reflects and shapes **our identity** (e.g., music taste, clothing brands, even yoga classes).
* Example: Gail, a business student, represents how personal preferences, emotions, and social surroundings affect choices.

---

### **Objective 1-2: Key Trends Shaping Consumer Behavior**

* **Technology** (social media, online reviews, AI) shapes how we shop and what we value.
* **Sociocultural changes** (shifts in gender identity, racial/ethnic identity, global cultures) influence what matters to people.
* Consumers are influenced by their **environment**, values, peer groups, and media.

---

### **Objective 1-3: Consumption‚Äôs Double Role**

* **Problem**: Overconsumption, pollution, fast fashion, and exploitation.
* **Solution**: Ethical consumption, sustainability, and value-based purchasing (like buying fair-trade or eco-friendly products).

---

### **Objective 1-4: What Fields Study Consumer Behavior?**

Consumer behavior is **interdisciplinary**, involving:

* **Psychology**: How people think and feel
* **Sociology**: Group influence and cultural trends
* **Anthropology**: Global and cultural rituals
* **Economics**: Spending behavior and decision-making
* **Marketing**: How to appeal to consumers through branding and strategy

---

### **Important Terms to Know**

* **Identity**: Made up of personal traits (like introversion) and social roles (like being a student).
* **Consumption Process**: It‚Äôs ongoing‚Äînot just the purchase moment, but everything before and after.
* **Meaning of Products**: We buy based on how a product makes us feel or who it helps us become, not just what it does.

---

### **Key Quote to Remember:**

> ‚ÄúPeople buy products not for what they do, but for what they mean.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs a clear and quiz-ready summary of the section **‚ÄúA Branded World‚Äù** to help you understand what matters most:

---

## **Key Ideas from "A Branded World"**

### 1. **What is a Brand?**

* A **brand** is more than a logo or name‚Äîit represents **identity, values, and cultural meaning**.
* Example: **Nike‚Äôs ‚Äúswoosh‚Äù** stands for performance, social activism (Kaepernick), and style. It‚Äôs not just shoes‚Äîit‚Äôs a statement.

---

### 2. **Branding & Consumer Identity**

* People are drawn to brands that match their **self-image** (e.g., being eco-friendly, stylish, athletic).
* Consumers may **reject brands** that clash with their identity or values.
* We live in a **branded culture** where ads shape views on beauty, success, lifestyle, and even politics.

---

### 3. **The Power of Symbols & Sensory Cues**

* Consumers respond to:

  * **Visuals** (logos, packaging)
  * **Sensory experiences** (taste, texture, smell)
  * **Spokescharacters** (like the Jolly Green Giant or Pillsbury Doughboy)
* Even **product names, ad images, and models** influence how we judge and connect with a brand.

---

### 4. **Cultural Influence**

* We‚Äôre influenced by global media‚Äî**brands help us ‚Äúexperience‚Äù other cultures** (e.g., food, music, fashion).
* Example: Watching YouTube influencers from other countries impacts what we want to buy or try.

---

### 5. **Why Understanding Consumers Matters**

* Good marketing = understanding **what people want now and in the future**.
* **Consumer needs evolve**, so brands must **innovate** to keep up.

  * BMW is a great example: electric cars for eco-conscious consumers, car sharing services, and recyclable materials.
* Companies that **adapt to trends** (like environmentalism or urban congestion) can stay ahead.

---

### **Real-World Application: BMW**

* **BMW i-series**: electric, stylish, eco-friendly.
* **Share Now**: car-sharing model fits with today‚Äôs need for **flexibility over ownership**.
